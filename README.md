TSGame is a TypeScript/PIXI.JS game. Not much has happened yet.

The build process utilizes Webpack to combine all code & dependencies into the resulting files `dist/bundle.js`, and `dist/index.html`. It will also copy the `src/assets` directory to `dist/assets`.

## Building

Clone the repo and run `npm install`. You can now use `npm build` to generate the website in the `dist/` directory, or you may alternatively use `npm start` to run an internal webserver at port 8080.
